# 🧠 Local RAG Engine (NestJS)

A **deterministic, production-style Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) backend** built with **NestJS**, **local embeddings**, **external vector storage**, **agentic validation**, and **streaming answers**.

---

## ✨ Key Capabilities

- ✅ Deterministic document ingestion (CLI-based)
- 🌍 Language-aware document handling (folder-based)
- 🧠 Local embeddings using **Xenova**
- 🗄 External vector storage using **ChromaDB**
- ⚡ Redis-based deduplication and chat state
- 🤖 Agentic query validation (LLM + evidence)
- 💬 Multi-turn chat with clarification handling
- 🌊 Streaming answers using **Gemini**
- 🧱 Clean, modular NestJS architecture

## 🧱 High-Level Architecture

    A[PDF Files] --> B(PDF Parser);
    B --> C(Text Splitter: sliding window);
    C --> D(Local Embeddings: Xenova);
    D --> E[Vector Store: ChromaDB];

### Chat flow:

Vector Signal Check

Agentic Validation (with snippets)

Retrieval (top-K chunks)

Context Assembly

LLM Streaming Answer (Gemini)


## 🌍 Language Handling (Deterministic)

Documents are grouped by **folder name**, which is the **source of truth** for language.
  - data/documents/en/.pdf → English
  - data/documents/ml/.pdf → Malayalam
  - data/documents/de/*.pdf → German

Why this approach?

- ✔ No language detection cost
- ✔ No misclassification
- ✔ Deterministic behavior
- ✔ Easy to scale

## 🧩 Core Components (What Each Does)

### 1️⃣ EmbeddingsService
- Uses **Xenova/all-MiniLM-L6-v2**
- Runs locally (no cloud dependency)
- Model is loaded once and reused

---

### 2️⃣ ChromaService
- Thin client to external **ChromaDB**
- Handles:
  - Upserts
  - Similarity search
- Acts as an adapter (normalizes external data)

---

### 3️⃣ VectorSignalService
- Cheap probe to check:
  > “Does the corpus contain anything related to this query?”
- Prevents unnecessary LLM calls

---

### 4️⃣ QueryValidatorAgent
- LLM-based agent
- Validates queries using **retrieved snippets**
- Handles:
  - Ambiguity
  - Out-of-scope queries
  - Clarification requests

---

### 5️⃣ RetrieverService
- Performs real similarity search (top-K)
- No thresholds, no guessing
- Pure retrieval logic

---

### 6️⃣ ContextAssemblerService
- Builds a safe, bounded context
- Prevents token overflow
- Preserves document sources

---

### 7️⃣ AnswerGeneratorService
- Streams answers using **Gemini**
- No hallucination:
  - Answers ONLY from provided context
- Retry + backoff on transient failures

---

### 8️⃣ ChatService (Orchestrator)
Coordinates the full flow:
Signal Check
→ Validation
→ Clarification Handling
→ Retrieval
→ Context Assembly
→ Streaming Answer

---

## 🔁 Ingestion Workflow (CLI)

### Command

```bash
npx ts-node src/cli.ts ingest:documents
```
#### What happens
  1. Crawl language folders
  2. Parse PDFs
  3. Split text (sliding window)
  4. Hash chunks (SHA-256)
  5. Deduplicate using Redis 
  6. Embed new chunks (Xenova)
  7. Upsert to ChromaDB

## 💬 Chat Workflow (Multi-Turn)

#### Example

User: What is life?

System: Did you mean LIFE Mission (Livelihood Inclusion and Financial Empowerment Mission)?

(State stored in Redis)

User: yes

System:
  - Resolves clarification
  - Rewrites query internally
  - Retrieves context
  - Streams grounded answer

✔ No hallucination
✔ Natural chat experience
✔ Deterministic state handling

## 🧠 Design Principles

  - Determinism over guessing
  - Evidence before reasoning
  - Clarify before answering
  - State in backend, not in LLM
  - Adapters isolate external systems
  - Fail closed, never hallucinate
